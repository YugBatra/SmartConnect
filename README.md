# SmartConnect: Connected Car Simulation (C++)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
SmartConnect simulates a connected car ecosystem in C++. It models telemetry such as **speed, fuel level, and GPS data** using object-oriented design.  
Validation hooks and test cases ensure telemetry stays within realistic ranges.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- C++ (OOP classes, methods)
- Validation & test hooks with `assert`

## ðŸš€ Setup & Run
Clone repo and compile:
```bash
g++ main.cpp Car.cpp -o smartconnect
./smartconnect
